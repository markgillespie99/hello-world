Hey everyone, I'm Mark.

I started working at InVision on 25th October 2017 as an Instructional Designer. I'm currently engaged due to get married to my partner of 8 years, Justine, in April 2018. As of yet we have no children but who knows what the future holds? 

Prior to commencing employement at InVision, I have 11 years Financial Services Contact Center experience with additional experience including (but not limited to):

* Learning Management System Administration & Implementation
* Authoring Tools - Namely Adobe Captivate, Microsoft Articulate & Storyline 2
* Implementing eLearning strategic initiatives at departmental level
* Organisational Change Management

Hobbies & Interests:

* Music - a mix of everything
* Playing sport - mostly soccer  
* Non-fictional reading. I'm very keen on Myers Briggs and anything that promotes further self-awareness and growth

This is where you can contact me.
